# Why c++ is general purpose programming language
    c++ is general purpose programming language because we can use in multi purpose way like networking programming, system programming and Computer applications programming.

# Why it is imperative programming language
    c++ is imperative programming language beacuse,
        - Imperative programming is a software development paradigm where functions are implicitly coded in every step required to solve a problem. 

        - In imperative programming, every operation is coded and the code itself specifies how the problem is to be solved, which means that pre-coded models are not called on. means pre-defined fucntions are not called for solving the problems.

### C++ is an object-oriented, multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic programming styles.

### One of the key features of C++ is its ability to support low-level, system-level programming, making it suitable for developing operating systems, device drivers, and other system software. At the same time, C++ also provides a rich set of libraries and features for high-level application programming, making it a popular choice for developing desktop applications, video games, and other complex applications. 

### It also supports Object Oriented Programming Language. C++ templates allow developers to write generic code that can work with any data type, making it easier to write reusable and flexible code.

### Standard Template Library (STL) provides a wide range of containers and algorithims for working with data, making it easier to write efficient and effective code.

### Exception Handling: C++ provides robust exception handling capabilities, making it easier to write code that can handle errors and unexpected situations.


# Features and key points of C++:
    - It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich library support and a variety of data-types.

    - A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.

    -  It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)

    - Rich library support: Has a rich library support (Both standard ~ built-in data structures, algorithms etc.) as well 3rd party libraries (e.g. Boost libraries) for fast and rapid development.

    - Speed of execution: C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as garbage-collection, dynamic typing etc. which slow the execution of the program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.

    - Pointer and Direct Memory Access: C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address. This helps in doing low-level programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables).

    - Object Oriented: One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-oriented support helps c++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e Large-Scale applications can be built. Procedural code becomes difficult to maintain as code-size grows.

    C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed.

# Here are some key points to keep in mind while working with C++:
    - Object-Oriented Programming: C++ is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it allows you to define classes and objects to model real-world entities and their behavior.
    
    - Strong Type System: C++ has a strong type system, which means that variables have a specific type and that type must be respected in all operations performed on that variable.

    - Low-level Access: C++ provides low-level access to system resources, which makes it a suitable choice for system programming and writing efficient code.

    - Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a large set of pre-written algorithms and data structures that can be used to simplify your code and make it more efficient.

    - Cross-platform Compatibility: C++ can be compiled and run on multiple platforms, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux, making it a versatile language for developing cross-platform applications.
    
    - Performance: C++ is a compiled language, which means that code is transformed into machine code before it is executed. This can result in faster execution times and improved performance compared to interpreted languages like Python.

    - Memory Management: C++ requires manual memory management, which can lead to errors if not done correctly. However, this also provides more control over the program’s memory usage and can result in more efficient memory usage.

    - Syntax: C++ has a complex syntax that can be difficult to learn, especially for beginners. However, with practice and experience, it becomes easier to understand and work with.
